# Customer Churn Time Series Modeling
Reducing customer churn is an essential part of business decision making. Voluntary, involuntary, downgrade, upgrade and seasonal churn all may be reasons as to why a customer might choose to end their relationship with a telecommunications company (“Customer churn rates,” 2023). However, seasonal churn may be a particularly difficult indicator to track as there could be multiple reasons as to why a customer decided to leave the telecommunications company. Time Series Modeling (TSM) can provide insight into seasonal customer churn by evaluating revenue trends over time. With the insights through this analysis, business executives will be able to develop marketing and discount strategies that adapt based on monthly or daily revenue trends.
